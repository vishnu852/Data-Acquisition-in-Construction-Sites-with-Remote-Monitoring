# Data-Acquisition-in-Construction-Sites-with-Remote-Monitoring
The construction company performs various works at various geological points. Currently, for these works the construction company will be having the site supervisors, who will be taking care of the various sites. The site supervisors currently furnishes only their weekly or monthly expenditure details and progress of works, because of this the Construction company has to wait, to know the expenditures and the progress of work made by the various construction site.This process is very much time consuming and it involves a lot of manual work to be carried out. To update the day to day activities, every site supervisor requires a computer with internet connection at their sites. They also require a camera to capture the construction status. To provide all these facilities at the remote site the construction company has to spend a huge sum of money, time, and space. So to surmount this problem a new framework was proposed. Thus an Android Based Mobile Application to Monitor Works at Remote Sites‚Äù has been proposed for the betterment of the construction company. By developing this application the Construction Company can easily record their progress of various works and their day-to-day expenditures that are made at various sites
